# Final-Year-Project
CARDIO CARE: INTELLIGENT RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM  FOR HEART DISEASE

A machine learning-powered web app designed to assess an individualâ€™s risk of developing heart disease based on lifestyle and clinical inputs. This AI-driven tool helps bridge the gap between raw health data and actionable insights for early intervention and preventive care.

## Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Traditional diagnostic tools are limited, invasive, and often inaccessible to many. CardioCare provides a fast, accurate, and non-invasive solution by leveraging machine learning algorithms and demographic, lifestyle, and medical history data.

## Key Features

- AI-driven predictions using Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
- Web-based interface built using **Streamlit**.
- Predictive breakdown of possible subtypes: CAD, Arrhythmia, Valve Disease, etc.
- Generates downloadable PDF reports.
- Custom dark/light themes with clean UI.

## Demo

Try the app locally or deploy it with tools like **Streamlit Sharing**, **Render**, or **Heroku**.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Streamlit** (Frontend Web UI)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**
- **FPDF** (for report generation)
- **Joblib/Pickle** (for model serialization)

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)
- Ensemble Voting Classifier
